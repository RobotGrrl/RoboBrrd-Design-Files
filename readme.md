# RoboBrrd Dimensions & AutoCAD Files

![RoboBrrd CAD](http://robotgrrl.com/robobrrd-cad.png)

## Overview

Here you will be able to find the dimensions and AutoCAD files for RoboBrrd. These were created prior to building the robot, then edited with the revisions.

If you are a [FIRST](http://usfirst.org) Robotics Mentor or student, you can grab your student copy of AutoCAD on the [Autodesk education community website](http://students.autodesk.com/).

We have also uploaded PDFs of various angles so that you can see the dimensions if you do not have AutoCAD.

You can learn more about RoboBrrd at [RobotGrrl.com](http://robotgrrl.com) and also read the [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/RoboBrrd/)!
